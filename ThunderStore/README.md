# Something Mod

# WARNING

## This mod has spoilers for the game "Omori"! A 'minimal spoiler' option is enabled by default but if you want to avoid all spoilers for the game I highly recommend playing the game first before playing with this mod. This mod also contains sensitive topics from the game that some people may find disturbing.
You can disable the 'minimal spoiler' option in the config if you want to enable all of the content. It mostly effects what polaroid images are used, so you can have it enabled or disabled per client.

## Behavior

Something works a lot like the ghost girl. When it spawns, it chooses a player to haunt the same way the ghost girl does. After it chooses a player, that players fear is tied to their insanity level for the rest of the day. You can lower your insanity with the breathing mechanic. Hold the `C` key to breath in, lowering insanity by a bit, and release to breath out. Don't let your insanity get too high!

More detailed behavior below:

<details>

<summary>Click here for spoilers</summary>

- Hallucinations happen more often the higher the insanity.
- Something will spawn `lesser_something`s and `little one`s.
- If you step on a `little one`, you will kill it and gain `1` insanity
- Walking into a `lesser_something` will play a loud sound, do some damage to the player and increase insanity by 5.
- Something will spawn and stare at the player randomly. If the player looks at Something, their insanity will increase by 10.
- If insanity reaches max insanity (50) Something will spawn and chase the player until they are around other players or leave the facility.
- If Something collides with the player during the chase, it will show a jumpscare and kill the player.
