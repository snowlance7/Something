## Behavior

Something works a lot like the ghost girl. When it spawns, it chooses a player to haunt the same way the ghost girl does. After it chooses a player, that players fear is tied to their insanity level for the rest of the day. You can lower your insanity with the breathing mechanic. Hold the `C` key to breath in, lowering insanity by a bit, and release to breath out. Don't let your insanity get too high!

More detailed behavior below:

<details>

<summary>Click here for spoilers</summary>

- Hallucinations happen more often the higher the insanity.
- Something will spawn `lesser_something`s and `little one`s.
- If you step on a `little one`, you will kill it and gain `1` insanity
- Walking into a `lesser_something` will play a loud sound, do some damage to the player and increase insanity by 5.
- Something will spawn and stare at the player randomly. If the player looks at Something, their insanity will increase by 10.
- If insanity reaches max insanity (50) Something will spawn and chase the player until they are around other players or leave the facility.
- If Something collides with the player during the chase, it will show a jumpscare and kill the player.
